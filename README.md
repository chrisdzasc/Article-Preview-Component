# 📰 Article Preview Component

A responsive article preview card with an interactive share tooltip.

## 📝 Overview

The project was developed as a high-fidelity implementation of a Figma design, focusing on creating a seamless interactive experience across mobile and desktop environments.

Key focus areas included managing distinct interaction states for the **share** component, implementing adaptive layout strategies using a mobile-first approach.

| **Active** | <img src="./assets/screenshots/meet-tablet.png"  /> | <img src="./assets/screenshots/meet-desktop.png" /> |

## 🎯 The Challenge

The challenge was to build out this **article preview component** and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

### Users should be able to:

- 📱 View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size.
- 🔗 See the social media share links when they click the share icon.
- ✨ Experience distinct interaction states for the share component: a bottom sheet on mobile and a floating tooltip on desktop.
